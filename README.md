# 1.Integrated System for face Detection and Attendence
During pandemic times, at our school (SPS Tronica). Staff manually made entries of each student entering the premises, which was a dumb idea ðŸ¥²! 
So we developed an AI powered by computer vision and machine learning which detects faces, temperature, date, and time and saves it in a CSV file.

# 2.Object detection 
This code uses a pre-trained object detection model to recognize objects in real-time from your webcam feed. The model was trained with labeled examples, which means it learned to identify objects based on images that had names for the things in them. When you run the code, it captures video, uses the model to find and label objects in each frame, and then displays the results with bounding boxes and names for the detected objects. This process shows how the model applies what it learned from training to new video footage.
