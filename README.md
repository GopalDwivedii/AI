# 1.Integrated System for face Detection and Attendence
During pandemic times, at our school (SPS Tronica). Staff manually made entries of each student entering the premises, which was a dumb idea ðŸ¥²! 
So we developed an AI powered by computer vision and machine learning which detects faces, temperature, date, and time and saves it in a CSV file.
